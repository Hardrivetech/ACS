    "link": "https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,\nAfter roughly 8 years of silently rolling 1.1 nightlies, we finally tagged a proper stable 2.0 release.\nWe built this because wrist-sized Linux is genuinely fun to hack on, and because a handful of us think it's worth keeping capable hardware alive long after manufacturers move on. Smartwatches don't really get old — the silicon is basically the same as it was a decade ago. We just keep making it useful for us.<p>No usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in our Matrix chat going \"hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and now it's usable again\" — and that's plenty.<p>Privacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good hardware become e-waste just because support ended.\nOn the learning side, it's been one of the best playgrounds: instant feedback on your wrist makes QML/Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind — perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without gatekeeping.<p>Technically we're still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on most devices since it just works, but we've already mainlined rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) — rinato even boots with a usable UI. That's the direction we're pushing toward.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/AsteroidOS</a> \nInstall images & docs: <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://asteroidos.org</a> \n2.0 demo video : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc</a> \nAnnouncement post: <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/</a><p>Questions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird ideas — all welcome. We do this because shaping a tiny, open wearable UX and infrastructure is oddly satisfying, and because Linux on the wrist still feels like a playground worth playing in.<p>Cheers, the AsteroidOS Team</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47051852\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47051852</a></p>\n<p>Points: 372</p>\n<p># Comments: 43</p>",

    "link": "https://github.com/n-e/pg-typesafe",
    "summary": "<p>Throughout my career, I tried many tools to query PostgreSQL, and in the end, concluded that for what I do, the simplest is almost always the best: raw SQL queries.<p>Until now, I typed the results manually and relied on tests to catch problems. While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s are deserialised as strings).<p>So I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would call node-pg, and they are fully typed.<p>It's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project, where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to remove many manual type definitions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050872\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050872</a></p>\n<p>Points: 64</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>",

    "title": "Show HN: Ghostty-based terminal with vertical tabs and notifications",
    "link": "https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux",
    "summary": "<p>I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just \"Claude is waiting for your input\" with no context, and with enough tabs open, I couldn't even read the titles anymore.<p>I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, colors, and more.<p>The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (cmux notify) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.<p>The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from agent-browser [1]. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, evaluate JS, and read console logs. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.<p>Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API – create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WxO5YUTOs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WxO5YUTOs</a><p>Repo (AGPL): <a href=\"https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47079718\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47079718</a></p>\n<p>Points: 138</p>\n<p># Comments: 60</p>",

    "link": "https://micasa.dev",
    "summary": "<p>micasa is a terminal UI that helps you track home stuff, in a single SQLite file. No cloud, no\naccount, no subscription. Backup with cp.<p>I built it because I was tired of losing track of everything in notes apps, and \"I'll remember\nthat\"s. When do I need to clean the dishwasher filter? What's the best quote for a complete\noverhaul of the backyard. Oops, found some mold behind the trim, need to address that ASAP. That\nsort of stuff.<p>Another reason I made micasa was to build a (hopefully useful) low-stakes personal project where\nthe code was written entirely by AI. I still review the code and click the merge button, but 99%\nof the programming was done with an agent.<p>Here are some things I think make it worth checking out:<p>- Vim-style modal UI. Nav mode to browse, edit mode to change. Multicolumn sort, fuzzy-jump to\n  columns, pin-and-filter rows, hide columns you don't need, drill into related records (like\n  quotes for a project). Much of the spirit of the design and some of the actual design choices\n  is and are inspired by VisiData. You should check that out too.\n- Local LLM chat. Definitely a gimmick, but I am trying preempt \"Yeah, but does it AI?\"-style\n  conversations. This is an optional feature and you can simply pretend it doesn't exist. All\n  features work without it.\n- Single-file SQLite-based architecture. Document attachments (manuals, receipts, photos) are\n  stored as BLOBs in the same SQLite database. One file is the whole app state. If you think\n  this won't scale, you're right. It's pretty damn easy to work with though.\n- Pure Go, zero CGO. Built on Charmbracelet for the TUI and GORM + go-sqlite for the database.\n  Charm makes pretty nice TUIs, and this was my first time using it.<p>Try it with sample data:\ngo install github.com/cpcloud/micasa/cmd/micasa@latest && micasa --demo<p>If you're insane you can also run micasa --demo --years 1000 to generate 1000 years worth of\ndemo data. Not sure what house would last that long, but hey, you do you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075124\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075124</a></p>\n<p>Points: 544</p>\n<p># Comments: 178</p>",

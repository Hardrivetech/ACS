    "title": "Show HN: Emdash – Open-source agentic development environment",
    "link": "https://github.com/generalaction/emdash",
    "summary": "<p>Hey HN! We’re Arne and Raban, the founders of Emdash (<a href=\"https://github.com/generalaction/emdash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/generalaction/emdash</a>).<p>Emdash is an open-source and provider-agnostic desktop app that lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel, each isolated in its own git worktree, either locally or over SSH on a remote machine. We call it an Agentic Development Environment (ADE).<p>You can see a 1 minute demo here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo</a><p>We are building Emdash for ourselves. While working on a cap-table management application (think Stripe Atlas + Pulley), we found our development workflow to be messy: lots of terminals, lots of branches, and too much time spent waiting on Codex.<p>Emdash puts the terminal at the center and makes it easy to run multiple agents at once. Each agent runs as a task in its own git worktree. You can start one or a few agents on the same problem, test, and review.<p>Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to agents, edit files manually, and review changes.<p>We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500–1000ms depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and avoid loading the shell environments on startup.<p>We believe using the providers’ native CLIs is the right approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent, always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have to add that first.<p>We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect what you have installed and we’re provider-agnostic by design. If there’s a provider you want that we don’t support yet, we can add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.<p>Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass. When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub, and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and lifecycle scripts so it’s easy to allocate ports and test changes.<p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.<p>Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.<p>We’d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents? We would want to learn more about it. Check out our repository here: <a href=\"https://github.com/generalaction/emdash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/generalaction/emdash</a><p>We’ll be around in the comments — thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47140322\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47140322</a></p>\n<p>Points: 153</p>\n<p># Comments: 59</p>",

    "title": "Show HN: Quantifying opportunity cost with a deliberately \"simple\" web app",
    "link": "https://shouldhavebought.com/",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,<p>A while ago I had a mildly depressing realization.<p>Back in 2010, I had around $60k. Like a \"responsible\" person, I used it as a down payment on an apartment. Recently, out of curiosity, I calculated what would have happened if I had instead put that money into NVIDIA stock.<p>I should probably add some context.<p>For over 10 years I've worked as a developer on trading platforms and financial infrastructure. I made a rule for myself - never trade on the market.<p>In 2015, when Bitcoin traded about 300 usd, my brother and I were talking about whether it was a bubble. He made a bold claim that one day it might reach $100k per coin. I remember thinking it sounded unrealistic - and even if it wasn't, I wasn't going to break my rule.<p>That internal tension - building systems around markets while deliberately staying out of them is probably what made the \"what if?\" question harder to ignore years later.<p>The result was uncomfortable. The opportunity cost came out to tens of millions of dollars.<p>That thought stuck with me longer than it probably should have, so I decided to build a small experiment to make this kind of regret measurable:\n<a href=\"https://shouldhavebought.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://shouldhavebought.com</a><p>At its core, the app does one basic thing:\nyou enter an asset, an amount, and two dates, and it gives you a plain numeric result - essentially a receipt for a missed opportunity.<p>I intentionally designed the UI to feel raw and minimal, almost like a late-90s terminal. No charts, no images, no emotional cushioning - just a number staring back at you.<p>What surprised me wasn't the result, but how much modern web infrastructure it took to build something that looks so simple.<p>Although the app is a single page with almost no UI elements, it still required:<p>- Client-side reactivity for a responsive terminal-like experience (Alpine.js)<p>- A traditional backend (Laravel) to validate inputs and aggregate historical market data<p>- Normalizing time-series data across different assets and events (splits, gaps, missing days)<p>- Dynamic OG image generation for social sharing (with color/state reflecting gain vs loss)<p>- A real-time feed showing recent calculations (\"Wall of Pain\"), implemented with WebSockets instead of a hosted service<p>- Caching and performance tuning to keep the experience instant<p>- Dealing with mobile font rendering and layout quirks, despite the \"simple\" UI<p>- Cron and queueing for historical data updates<p>All of that just to show a number.<p>Because markets aren't one-directional, I also added a second mode that I didn't initially plan: \"Bullet Dodged\".\nIf someone almost bought an asset right before a major crash, the terminal flips state and shows how much capital they preserved by doing nothing. In practice, this turned out to be just as emotionally charged as missed gains.<p>Building this made me reflect on how deceptive \"simplicity\" on the web has become. As a manager I know says: \"Just add a button\". But even recreating a deliberately primitive experience today requires understanding frontend reactivity, backend architecture, real-time transport, social metadata, deployment, and performance tradeoffs.<p>I didn't build this as a product so much as an experiment - part personal curiosity, part technical exploration.<p>I'd be very interested to hear how others think about:<p>Where they personally draw the line on stack complexity for small projects?<p>Whether they would have gone fully static + edge functions for something like this?<p>How much infrastructure is \"too much\" for a deliberately minimal interface?<p>And, optionally, what your worst \"should have bought\" moment was?<p>Happy to answer any technical questions or dig into specific implementation details if useful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47138631\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47138631</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",

    "link": "https://blackboard.sh/blog/electrobun-v1/",
    "summary": "<p>I'm building a commercial macOS app with Electrobun [1]. I have previously written the same app with Tauri. I'll say that, while I love Tauri, using Electrobun has been an absolute breeze. I got the same app done in roughly 70% of the time [2]. It's a very productive stack. In no small part due to Electrobun, but also the fact that Bun has tons of DX niceties and a builtin bundler.<p>Electrobun lets you open/manipulate/close webview windows and communicate with them using typed rpc. It also handles building, code signing, and notarization.<p>And because I'm using Bun, running an HMR + React + Tailwind server is just one command (`bun ./index.html`) or like 5 lines of code. Pass --console and the webview's console.log()s get streamed to your Terminal too.<p>There's tons of other things Electrobun does that I haven't even mentioned, because I haven't interacted much with them yet. E.g. I know that it lets you show platform-native notifications, prompts/popups, etc.<p>There also is a very impressive updating mechanism that relies on a bsdiff implementation written in Zig. You just ship the deltas, so updates to very large apps are just a few KBs most of the time.<p>It's genuinely a very productive stack and impressive piece of tech.<p>[1] Not affiliated - I just like the project.<p>[2]: The API and implementation was clear, so I'll cautiously say this is not a case of \"rewrites are always faster\". In fact, the Tauri version was a rewrite too :)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069650\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069650</a></p>\n<p>Points: 91</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>",
